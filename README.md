# spamfilter

Goal : Build a model for identifying if a question on Quora is spam 


1. To bring down dimensions of your model you can use glove embedding shared with you ( in the data )

2. Using pertained embeddings : https://blog.keras.io/using-pre-trained-word-embeddings-in-a-keras-model.html

3. Create and maintain your own train/validation splits for the full data
